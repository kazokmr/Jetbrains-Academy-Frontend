## About

A good way to make yourself known in the world of programming is to create a portfolio. It is really good when all of
your impressive achievements, skills, and samples are collected in one place. If you know the basics of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, you can even publish your portfolio on the website you created yourself! This project is a great way to
present yourself as a specialist.

## Learning outcomes

You will write a one-page site with its own design and interactive elements. You will learn how to make your site
adaptable to different screen sizes and browser versions. In the process, you will build your confidence in working with
HTML.
